# Averroes STEM Learning Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive online learning platform designed for students and professionals seeking in-depth, structured content in mathematics and programming. It combines high-quality theoretical explanations, practical examples, and curated exercises into a cohesive digital environment.

The platform emphasizes clarity, rigor, and accessibility. It is structured to allow learners to progress systematically, whether they are studying mathematics, C, C++, HTML, or CSS. The content is modular, color-coded, and meticulously formatted to enhance readability and retention.

## Features

- **Structured Learning Path:** Each subject is divided into carefully designed lessons, progressing from fundamental concepts to advanced topics.
- **Mathematics Modules:** Covers foundational and advanced mathematics courses, including HM1, HM2, HM3, real analysis and linear algebra, with LaTeX/KaTeX-rendered formulas for professional clarity.
- **Programming Modules:** Step-by-step tutorials for C, C++, HTML, and CSS, including best practices, syntax explanations, and advanced programming techniques.
- **Electrical Engineering Modules:** Fundamental courses in various modules covered in an electrical engineering degree, such as Mikroelektronik and Grundlagen der Elektrotechnik.
- **PDF Resources:** For some of the presented modules, downloadable PDFs consolidate lecture notes, exercises, and problem sets for offline study.
- **Interactive Web Design:** Lessons utilize a consistent, intuitive color-coded scheme to differentiate definitions, examples, and notes, improving learner navigation.
- **Responsive and Accessible:** Fully responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile, following accessibility best practices.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap CSS, JavaScript, KaTeX for mathematical rendering.
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages for fast, reliable, and free deployment.
- **Design Principles:** Modular CSS, semantic HTML, and clear typographical hierarchy for readability and maintainability.

## Architecture

- Modular folder structure separating content, quizzes, and components
- Reusable quiz engine powered by dynamic question objects
- ACE editor integrated for in-browser code execution
- KaTeX rendering pipeline for mathematical expressions
- Client-side state handling for randomized quizzes

## Technical Challenges

- Implemented randomized answer shuffling without breaking correct answer mapping.
- Designed a reusable quiz structure scalable across multiple modules.
- Integrated third-party code editors while preserving responsive layout.
- Optimized GitHub Pages deployment for static hosting constraints.

## Educational Approach

- **Depth & Clarity:** Each lesson is written to provide both conceptual understanding and practical application.
- **Progressive Learning:** Concepts build sequentially, ensuring foundational knowledge before tackling advanced topics.
- **Visual Guidance:** Color-coded elements distinguish theoretical definitions, worked examples, and supplementary notes.
- **Flexible Access:** Designed for learners who prefer either offline study (via PDFs) or interactive online content.

## Target Audience

- University students in engineering, computer science, and mathematics programs.
- Self-learners seeking professional-grade content for C, C++, HTML, CSS, or mathematics.
- Educators looking for structured, ready-to-use teaching material.

## Project Goals

- Provide a **cohesive, high-quality digital learning experience**.
- Make complex subjects **approachable without compromising rigor**.
- Support **self-paced and structured learning** through modular content and downloadable resources.
- Encourage **best practices in programming and mathematics** through clear, professional examples.
